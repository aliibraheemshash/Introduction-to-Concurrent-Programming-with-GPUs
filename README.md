# 🚀 Introduction to Concurrent Programming with GPUs (PyTorch 2.6.0 + CUDA 12.4)

Welcome to this repository!  
Here, I’ll start uploading simple, clear, and well-structured examples for learning **concurrent programming** using **PyTorch 2.6.0** with **CUDA 12.4**.

This repo is meant to be a **good starting point** — especially for students and researchers interested in the intersection of **image processing**, **computer vision**, and **GPU acceleration**.

## 📌 Why Learn Concurrent Programming with PyTorch?

Modern AI applications, especially in computer vision, deal with large amounts of data -- high-resolution images, videos, real-time detection, and more.  
Running such workloads efficiently requires **leveraging GPU parallelism**. PyTorch offers a high-level yet powerful framework that abstracts away CUDA complexities while still giving you **performance** and **flexibility**.

### 🌟 Learning this is essential because:

- 🔬 **For Researchers**: Faster experiments = faster research. GPU concurrency saves time and enables larger model training.
- 🧑‍🎓 **For Students**: Builds a deep understanding of how AI models scale and perform in real-world tasks.
- 📸 **For Vision Tasks**: Tasks like image segmentation, object detection, and style transfer thrive on GPU speed.
- 💡 **Conceptual Clarity**: Understanding how PyTorch manages tasks concurrently on the GPU is the bridge between theory and production.
